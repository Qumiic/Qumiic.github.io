                <h4>CPU</h4>
                <p>
                    Central Processing Unit.The primary component of a computer responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. 
                    It is often referred to as the <b>"brain"</b> of the computer. The CPU interprets and carries out instructions from computer programs, 
                    handling tasks such as arithmetic operations, logic operations, and managing data movements within the computer's memory.

                <h4>RAM</h4>
                <p>
                    Random Access Memory. A temporary storage area that holds data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly. 
                    RAM allows the CPU to work with data rapidly, improving the computer's performance.

                <h4>Storage Devices</h4>
                <p>
                    Computers have various types of storage devices for long-term data retention. 
                    The most common ones are Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs), 
                    which store the operating system, software, files, and data.
